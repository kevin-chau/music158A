Project Proposal:
	For our midterm project we propose to build and design a standalone DJ application utilizing smart abstraction and odot structures within max in order to tackle the large scale and modularity of such an application. Our main hardware interface will be the Native Instruments Traktor S4, a large 4 track mixer, audio interface, and midi controller which will allow us to manipulate multiple audio channels as well as fully customizable continuous control that far exceeds the capabilities of the esplora. The hardware has potentiometers, sliders, and endless encoders that meet the requirement for 1D continuous control; for 2d control we will be using a device with an x-y accelerometer, mostly for the purpose of controlling an XY pad like effects combination. In proposing this project, we realize that this controller has already been designed and optimized for the manufacturers own program, Traktor Pro DJ, however, the purpose of our project is not to emulate or to simply provide an alternative programming exercise to what has already been done in digital DJ software. Rather, our intention is to extend the imaginative and creative possibilities of a DJ application by picking up on the pitfalls of past applications that we have become familiar with in our DJing experience. Our secondary motivation is to deeply understand the inner workings of DJ software--the digital sound processing, algorithms, and programming structures required to build basic digital DJ programs. We also intend for this project to be extendable; in the future, we plan to add a song browser interface (integrating an itunes like UI into the program), a hashtable based midi device programming menu (so that we can on the fly map any usb midi device to our DJ application), integrate our program into the much larger live performance work space in Ableton, and ultimately, design a DJing AI that can mix together long setlists of given songs. In making such a UI, we will have to deeply analyze our own mixing techniques as well as looking into the true music theory behind DJing and electronically mixed music.
